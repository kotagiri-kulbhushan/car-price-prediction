Project Overview

Car Price Prediction is a web application that predicts car selling prices based on various car features such as year, present price, kilometers driven, fuel type, seller type, transmission, and owner history. 
The app uses a Machine Learning model trained on real car sales data to generate accurate price predictions.
This project demonstrates end-to-end ML deployment with a Flask backend and a scalable cloud deployment on Render.
